# SQL-internship-Task-5
In this task worked with aggreigate functions like count,min,max,sum
in this if we use count with count(*) means count of all it also includes the null values
count(column) means count with specific column that not count or it ignored null values
sum() aggregate function is used to sum 
by using min aggregate we can easily find the minimum value 
max is used to find the maximum value
avg i used to find the average value
in this we also use the group by ,having clause
with aggregate funcction
